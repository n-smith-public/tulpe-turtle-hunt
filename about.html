        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="aboutMe">
            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Nick, and I am an Eagle Scout and Brotherhood member of Tulpe Lodge. This is my second NOAC. Academically, I am a rising Sophomore at WPI (Worcester Polytechnic Institute)</p>
            <p>I recently took a database class this summer, and when we were asked to think of a use for a database in a practical setting, I thought of making an experiment like this.</p>
            <p>I've dabbled a bit in website development, but this was a project unlike any other I have done so far. This is built upon Github, Render, Redis, and AWS to work, only one of which I've worked with in the past.</p>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying Computer Science, with a minor in History. I am a member of Masque Theatre, the Marching and Pep Band, Kilroy Sketch Comedy, as well as a few other groups on campus.</p>
            <p>Back home, I have two dogs, Max and Ruby.</p>
            <h2>About The Project</h2>
            <p>This experiment was inspired by the Cruise Ship Ducks that some cruise lines have. For those unfamiliar, people will hide ducks around cruises they go on that say where they come from, and there's a whole community built around it.</p>
            <p>I got some turtles, the symbol of Tulpe Lodge, and decided to make this system. I want to learn more about who is attending NOAC, and I believe that the information that is gathered through this will be fun to look at.</p>
            <p>I've made an Instagram page for anyone interested in seeing some information about the results after NOAC concludes, as well as some pictures of people with their turtles if they decide to send them.</p>
            <p>If you want to be posted on it, please send a DM to the account. The account handle is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/noac.turtles">@noac.turtles</a></p>
